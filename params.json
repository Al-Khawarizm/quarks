{"name":"Quarks","tagline":"This repository collects all of the community contributed Super Collider Quarks","body":"# quarks\r\n\r\nQuarks are packages of [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) code containing classes, extension methods, documentation and server UGen plugins. The Quarks class manages downloading these packages and installing or uninstalling them.\r\n\r\nThis repository collects all of the community contributed Super Collider Quarks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n___Most importantly it contains the file `directory.txt` which is the index that the Quarks interface fetches.___\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks/blob/master/directory.txt\r\n\r\n1. This specifies the location and latest version of each community Quarks.\r\n\r\n2. It is editable. Follow the link above and just click edit.\r\n\r\n3. This repository also includes each Quark as a git subtree. This allows the entire Quarks library to be downloaded as a single file for offline usage.\r\nThe update.py script reads the current directory.txt and updates the subtree items.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using Quarks\r\n\r\nTo install Quarks inside see the SuperCollider help file `Using Quarks`.\r\n\r\nYou can install Quarks:\r\n\r\n### using the gui\r\n\r\n```supercollider\r\nQuarks.gui\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis offers many community contributed packages most of which are hosted on github.\r\n\r\nYou can also add additional folders where you keep your personally developed quarks or those you have forked or manually downloaded.\r\nThese will also be shown on the GUI as options for installing.\r\n\r\n```supercollider\r\n// put this in your startup.scd\r\nQuarks.addFolder(\"~/supercollider/quarks\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### by name\r\n\r\nYou can (un)install a Quark by name:\r\n\r\n```supercollider\r\nQuarks.install(\"UnitTesting\");\r\nQuarks.uninstall(\"UnitTesting\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### by git URL\r\n\r\n```supercollider\r\nQuarks.install(\"https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/UnitTesting.git\");\r\nQuarks.uninstall(\"https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/UnitTesting.git\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n### from a local folder\r\n\r\n```supercollider\r\n// add your own classes\r\nQuarks.install(\"~/supercollider/quarks/my-thing\");\r\n// install something that you downloaded and want to try out\r\nQuarks.install(\"~/Downloads/something-i-found\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Adding a Quark to this Directory\r\n\r\nGo here, click edit and submit a pull request:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks/blob/master/directory.txt\r\n\r\nThe format is:\r\n\r\n    quarkname=git://github.com/you/quarkname\r\n\r\nIdeally you should tag your releases with the version number and then specify it in the directory.txt:\r\n\r\n    quarkname=git://github.com/you/quarkname@tags/0.1.0\r\n\r\nThe version is specified as a git refspec. `tags/x.y.z` is the preferred form.\r\n\r\n## Tag your releases\r\n\r\nTagged version numbers will allow people to download a .tgz archive of the release and will enable people to switch between different versions.\r\n\r\nUsers can see and switch between versions in the interface, but only if they are tagged.\r\n\r\nIt will also enable people to specify an exact version of your quark when working on their own projects.\r\n\r\nNote that a refspec is either tags/{tagname} or {commit-hash} but not a branch name. A branch is a continually changing, and packages releases need to be pinned.\r\n\r\n## Migrated Quarks from SVN\r\n\r\nI (@crucialfelix) migrated the old SVN repository to github and preserved all the commits, dates and authorship.\r\n\r\nYou will find your old work here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/supercollider-quarks\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing to do is to just fork your Quark from here into your own account. It will appear as \"forked from ...\" on your github.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to git clone your quark from here and then create a fresh repository in your own github/bitbucket account and push it to there. Then it will not say \"forked from...\" Remember to set your working copy's upstream origin to your own github version.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to transfer ownership, but for that you need to have admin access to both the supercollider-quarks group and the account you are transferring it to. Contact us and we can add you as an admin to supercollider-quarks.\r\n\r\nIf you've already moved your code to github or some other git host and want to use that version then just edit directory.txt to point to your preferred newer version.\r\n\r\nAfter you've moved we can delete the quark from here to reduce any confusion.\r\n\r\n### Backward incompatibilities\r\n\r\nQuarks with spaces in the name had to have those spaces removed (\"SenseWorld MiniBee\" -> SWMiniBee).\r\n\r\nThe 'name' field is no longer required in the quark file, but its nice to have. The official name of the Quark is now the same name as the folder and the name of the git repository.\r\n\r\nQuarks nested inside other quarks (dewdrop_lib) are now un-nested.\r\n\r\nThe 'path' field is now obsolete and ignored.\r\n\r\n## Download all quarks\r\n\r\nThis entire repository can be downloaded for use while offline or if cannot for some reason use git on your machine.\r\n\r\nThey will be downloadable here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/supercollider-quarks/quarks/releases\r\n\r\n## Updating the subtree\r\n\r\nAfter any updates to the directory.txt file someone should run the script `update.py` in this repository.\r\nThis will read the directory file and update all of the git subtrees .\r\n\r\nIn terminal run the python script passing it your quark's name\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n    python update.py quarkname\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo update all quarks:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n    python update.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will clone, update and/or checkout tags as needed. If the repository URL changes then it will first remove the previous quark and clone the new one in its place.\r\n\r\nThe update script will `git add` the changes but will not commit them.\r\n\r\nCommit your changes:\r\n\r\n    git commit -m \"updated quarkname to version 4.1.3\" -a\r\n\r\nAnd submit a pull request.\r\n\r\n## Releases of supercollider-quarks\r\n\r\nBy tagging this repository we will enable a downloadable release. We should do a release every once in a while, especially when SuperCollider itself publishes a release.\r\n\r\nWe will worry about that after everybody is using the new Quarks.  Maybe nobody will even need the downloaded version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/supercollider-quarks/quarks?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
